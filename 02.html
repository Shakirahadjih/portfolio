            <p class="p">Creating a visualization to show teenagers what a filter bubble is involved designing a visual representation of the concept that effectively communicates its meaning and impact. The visualization uses small animations to illustrate how social media algorithms and personal preferences can lead to a narrow, biased view of the world.
            </p>

            <p class="p">The goal is to help teenagers understand how the filter bubble can limit their exposure to diverse perspectives and ideas, and to encourage them to seek out a broader range of information sources.
            </p>

            <p class="p">The small project I did for Responsible IT. The lectorate focuses on responsible innovation and design of IT systems and aims to bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications in industry. The lectorate's research agenda is based on four themes: design for values, ethics and technology, digital human rights, and responsible data science.
